# Magic Vendor
by Charles Berghausen, Annabel Rice, Katherine Kim, Jackson Tidland for CSE237

The magic vending machine randomly selects a magic price range in which the customer will get their items for free. However, your shopping time is limited, and you will only be blessed with free snacks if you finish your selection in time and reach an after-tax total within the magic range.

Built in Java and used via the command line. Usage instructions will be written below as we develop functionality.
