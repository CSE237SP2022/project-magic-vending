# Magic Vendor
by Charles Berghausen, Annabel Rice, Katherine Kim, Jackson Tidland for CSE237

The magic vending machine randomly selects a magic price range in which the customer will get their items for free. However, your shopping time is limited, and you will only be blessed with free snacks if you finish your selection in time and reach an after-tax total within the magic range.


Built in Java and used via the command line. Usage instructions will be written below as we develop functionality.
* What user stories were completed this iteration?
    * This iteration starts with our user being prompted to input their initial bear bucks balance, our magic vending machine only allows users who input a balance equal to or greater than the ‘magic’ value. 
    * The ‘magic’ value is a target total that the user is trying to approximate while getting items they want 
* What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
    * In the next iteration we hope to add more options and potentially the option for different mediums of payment. 
* Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
     * The looping user prompt to add to the cart vs. checking out has to be fixed, however our iteration has a functional range and bear bucks user prompt
* What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
    * Usage: clone this repo; run $ ./PlayVendor.sh
